<div class="para">The foremost reason an improvement was needed to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is its failure to terminate in certain cases of networks with irrational capacities. As the algorithm is successful in constructing a maximum flow whenever it terminates, an improvement to the algorithm was more likely than a replacement. Dinitz' improvement utilized shortest paths to overcome the conceptual flaw in Ford-Fulkerson during the step of finding an augmenting path. Hence we will first discuss the modification to Dikstra's algorithm which produces the necessary shortest path graph.</div>
