<div class="para">A general analysis of text shows the most frequently occurring English letters to be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ETAOIN SHRDLU</code>, which the above table shows to be correct (up to reordering). Hence if these letters can be correctly matched in the mapping, there are only <span class="process-math">\(14!=87178291200\)</span> remaining permutations. Even this is insurmountable to check by hand, but context can help greatly; looking over a long passage which has been partially decrypted often allows one to make reasonable guesses to other mappings of characters under a simple substitution. Unfortunately, this often requires a lot of guessing and checking, which is unreasonable without other tools from frequency analysis: there are only two one-letter words in English (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">I</code>) relatively few common two-letter words (about 24 of them), and the frequency order for two-letter pairs (digraphs) and three-letter pairs (tri-graphs) can also be studied.</div>
