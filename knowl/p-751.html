<div class="para">All joking aside, graph theory and the larger discipline of combinatorics are deeply applicable fields. There are many pratical, real world problems which are modeled by discrete systems (rather than continuous systems, such as used in differential equations or traditional applied math courses), and graph theory techniques are often the best solution to these problems. So while combinatorics is not generally considered part of applied mathematics, it is very much <em class="emphasis">applicable mathematics</em>.</div>
