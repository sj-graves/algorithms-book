<div class="para">Thankfully we are not unarmed when it comes to decrypting a monoalphabetic substitution. Even though the pool of possible permutations is vast, we can analyze the frequencies with which each letter is used in normal text to try to determine parts of the mapping. It is quite easy to write a program in Python counting the frequency of occurrence of each letter in a string. For instance, taking the original 1972 etext of the Declaration of Independence from <a class="external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1/pg1.txt" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> and converting it into all capital letters (which is how it was produced in 1972 since computers didn't have minuscule letters at that early date), we obtain the following results for the 8133 characters in the text:</div>
