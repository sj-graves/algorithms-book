<div class="para">The mathematician Paul Erdős is renowned for having been one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, as well as one of the most social: he wrote papers with more than 500 collaborators over his career. Due to his frequent collaborations, one of his coauthors assigned to Paul an “Erdős number” of 0, for being Paul Erdős. Each of Erdős's coauthors were assigned an Erdős number of 1. Their coauthors who did not coauthor with Erdős were assigned an Erdős number of 2, and so on.</div>
