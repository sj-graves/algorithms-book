<div class="para">Recalling that the modified Dijkstra's algorithm provides a sort of “predecessor graph”, we have obtained the capacitated network shown in the figure as (B). The second step of producing the layered data structure is to apply Dijkstra's algorithm on this intermediate graph, rooted now at the target vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_5\text{.}\)</span> As the graph is directed, we see that vertices <span class="process-math">\(v_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_6\)</span> are unreachable in the intermediate graph when rooted at <span class="process-math">\(v_5\text{;}\)</span> hence the resulting layered graph of the figure labelled (C) has vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> at distance <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> vertices <span class="process-math">\(v_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_3\)</span> at distance <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_5\)</span> at distance <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span>
