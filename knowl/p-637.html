<div class="para">In the algorithms in this section, it is clearest to speak of performing an elementary row operation on a matrix as an in-place change of the matrix. This replaces the awkwardness of keeping track of an index of a last element of a sequence as the sequence is being built. In implementation it is simple enough to perform these changes on a copy of the original matrix, or even simply on a copy of the list-of-lists making up the data of the matrix. We use the notation <span class="process-math">\(A\xmapsto{\phi} A\)</span> to represent that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is transformed by the operation <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{;}\)</span> this shortens the two steps of <span class="process-math">\(A\xto{\phi}A'\)</span> followed by assigning <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to take the value of <span class="process-math">\(A'\)</span> into a single step of notation.</div>
