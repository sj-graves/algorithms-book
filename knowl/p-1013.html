<div class="para">There is a school of engineering design called by many names which expresses the belief that “a system should only fail into a known state” or that “a system that fails should do so securely.” Applied to programming this idea is expressed in <dfn class="terminology">exception handling</dfn> where  violations of the logic of a program are anticipated and treated before they occur. As we should perhaps expect, Python implements this with a block data structure, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">try:... except:...</code> block.</div>
