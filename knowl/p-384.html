<div class="para">To talk about the type of functions called linear transformations, we need first to talk about what types of things are domains and codomains of these functions. The basic space of intetrest is a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn>. In many physical contexts a vector is simply a <em class="emphasis">directed magnitude</em>, which is to say some amount of measurement pointing along an arrow. Unfortunately, that is not a good definition, because it relies on a property which is not actually necessary for all of the things we want to do with vectors.</div>
