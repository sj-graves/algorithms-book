</h4> <div class="para">One of the best ways to learn programming is to simply learn by experimentation, but a minimal working knowledge of syntax and programming methods is needed before that is possible. Another very good way to learn to program is to manually type in code from another source, seeking to explain and understand it along the way. If you transcribe another person's program into your own, try to put an explanatory comment on every line to see if you understand what the program is doing!</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-intro-functions.html#remark-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
