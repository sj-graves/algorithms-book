<div class="para">We begin with a problem posed in concrete terms: we have a network consisting of several nodes which we wish to connect together, and we know that there is a certain cost associated with connecting pairs of nodes. It should be obvious that we wish to minimize the cost of connecting our network, and for the sake of simplicity we will make the assumption that our network is reliable; that is, once two nodes are connected, they will stay connected. Therefore we only need to make sure everything is connected to the network once.</div>
