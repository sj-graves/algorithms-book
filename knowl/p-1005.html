<div class="para">What might seem a better way to write a Collatz-sequence program would be to start building a sequence at the input number <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code> and continue as long as the last element of the sequence is not 1, but there are several serious problems with that approach. First and foremost, if the Collatz conjecture is actually false, there is some input <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code> for which that program would never terminate! Since all current research indicates that the Collatz conjecture is probably true, the other worse problem is that generating a long sequence uses up system memory in the computer, and eventually (for a long enough sequence) you could run out of memory and crash Python! The good news is that running a computer out of memory in this way causes no long-term problems; quitting Python is usually enough to solve the problem and allow the operating system to reallocate that memory.</div>
