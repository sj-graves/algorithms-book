<div class="para">For our very small example here it is easy enough to do this on a piece of paper, keeping track of all of the connected pieces in a table. As soon as we look at the first edge, we have to make a decision about which piece of the network is will gain a vertex and which piece will become empty; in order to make this easy for ourselves, we opt to always merge into the large piece, or if the two pieces have the same number of vertices we will merge into the piece whose initial vertex had a smaller numerical index.</div>
