<div class="para">To make a notational distinction, we will separate the ideas of <dfn class="terminology">encoding</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">encrypting</dfn>. Encoding is the process by which a natural written language is transferred into a different symbol set, usually for the purpose of transmission. Encryption, on the other hand, is the process by which information is hidden from unintended recipients. Sometimes a simple encoding is used as encryption, but there are relatively easy mathematical tools to decode messages which have been encoded but not encrypted. Some of the same tools are useful to break low-security encryption, as well!</div>
