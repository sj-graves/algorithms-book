<div class="para">In 1956, Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra developed an algorithm for solving this problem. His solution, now known as <em class="emphasis">Dijkstra's algorithm</em>, is both elegant and simple. A <em class="emphasis">root vertex</em> is specified as having distance 0; its neighbors have distance 1. The neighbors of those vertices with distance 1 are next specified to have distance 2, unless they previously had distance 0; and so on. Those vertices which cannot be reached by a path from the root have distance <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span>
