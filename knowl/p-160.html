<div class="para">The study of group theory was inspired by the work of Lagrange on generalizations of permutation groups. This and many other topics are introduced to undergraduate math majors in their first course in Abstract Algebra, which is almost totally focused on group theory. An important result in group theory  is <em class="emphasis">Cayley's Theorem</em>, which is especially important for those working with groups in an applied setting.</div>
