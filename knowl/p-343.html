<div class="para">If this were the only complication of the Enigma device, it would be a very physically complicated monoalphabetic substitution. The genius of the Enigma is that when a key is pressed, a rotation mechanism would engage. The right rotor <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> would step, and upon reaching a notch in its mechanism would make the middle rotor step. This in turn could turn the left rotor in the same way. Of the eight rotors in use during World War II, rotors VI, VII, and VIII each had two such notches, providing an irregular stepping to break up the odometer-style pattern of rotor stepping. The result of this stepping mathematically is equivalent to shifting <em class="emphasis">just the bottom row</em> of the two-line notation for that rotor's permutation by one position to the left. It is this stepping which makes Enigma polyalphabetic â€” the permutation changes with each letter encrypted.</div>
