<div class="para">There are many, many different formulations for the definition of a graph. Some definitions are suffiently relaxed that an edge can loop back from a vertex to itself â€” these are generally called <em class="emphasis">loops</em>. Likewise, edges can be defined as independent objects with <em class="emphasis">endpoints</em>, which allows for more than one edge to have vertices <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> as endpoints. We make the distinction that graphs which have loops or multiple edges are <em class="emphasis">multigraphs</em>. In fact some graph theorists extend the definition even further to allow edges to have more than two vertices</div>
