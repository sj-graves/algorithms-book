<div class="para">A further feature of the Enigma machine is that every setting of rotors and plugboard results in a <em class="emphasis">derangement</em>. This feature was patented prior to World War II, when Enigma was sold commercially, and greatly aided Polish algebraist Marian Rejewski in his work to break the encryption. The Polish <em class="emphasis">bombe</em> machine was another electro-mechanical device, this one invented to break the Enigma code; it was refined by Alan Turing at the Bletchley Park codebreaking office in Englad during World War II and used as a major part of the war effort to decrypt Nazi transmissions. These devices in turn led to the Colossus project, which created the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer.</div>
