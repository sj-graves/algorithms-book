<div class="para">The algorithm proceeds from here inductively: suppose <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is the vertex most recently added to <span class="process-math">\(V(T)\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(N(u)\)</span> be the neighbors of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\Gamma\)</span> which are not already vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(v\in N(u)\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(C(v) = \min(C(v),C(u)+w(uv))\text{.}\)</span> In the case where the cost of a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is changed, denote <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> as the predecessor of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> After so considering each vertex, any vertex of <span class="process-math">\(V\setminus V(T)\)</span> of least cost is the next vertex to add to <span class="process-math">\(V(T)\text{.}\)</span> As long as the original graph is connected, every vertex will eventually be added to <span class="process-math">\(V(T)\text{,}\)</span> and since no edge is added between a new vertex and an old vertex of <span class="process-math">\(V(T)\text{,}\)</span> the result is necessarily a tree.</div>
