<div class="para">Unfortunately when the key phrase is too short these ciphers are vulnerable to another attack involving frequency analysis, this time coupled with a tool called the <dfn class="terminology">index of coincidence</dfn>, <span class="process-math">\(IC\text{.}\)</span> Calculating the index of coincidence of a text and comparing it to the expected index of coincidence for the language permits the detection of a likely shift cipher. In the very specific circumstance that you believe a Vigen√®re cipher with a short key phrase has been used to encrypt a message, you can compute a <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> index of coincidence, which calculates the <span class="process-math">\(IC\)</span> for each string obtained by skipping <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> characters at a time. If all such skipping strings show an <span class="process-math">\(IC\)</span> value close to the original language, it is likely that the correct key phrase length has been detected.</div>
