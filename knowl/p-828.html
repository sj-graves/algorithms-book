<div class="para">The graph <span class="process-math">\(\Lambda\)</span> is referred to as a layered structure since we can think of the vertices as lying in distance layers away from <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> such that any edge <span class="process-math">\(uv\in E_\ell\)</span> has the property <span class="process-math">\(\dist{\Delta_f}{s}{v}=\dist{\Delta_f}{s}{u}+1\text{.}\)</span> Thus maintaining those layers means we need no special algorithm to find augmenting paths: any path emanating from <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> in a well-maintained layered graph will eventually terminate at <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> The order in which paths are followed can change the final assignment of flow to edges, but interestingly cannot change the total final value of the flow. The flow assigned along the path is the minimum residual capacity along any edge of the path.</div>
