<div class="para">The grid provides the permutation of digraphs in a rather clever way, and it's a <dfn class="terminology">symmetric key</dfn>, meaning that the same key (the grid itself) is used to encrypt messages as is used to decrypt ciphertexts. As a message, suppose we want to encrypt the ridiculous message “The bookkeeper remains sequestered. The suq question remains bizarre. Tax Xavier.” This message is chosen because it has many double letters, which have to be treated carefully in another pre-processing step.</div>
