</h4> <div class="para">You do not have to use IDLE. Any text editor will work to edit your files (such as Notepad) and once you have the Python interpreter installed, you can run Python scripts. That being said, it's often easiest to write code inside an IDE so that you can use some sort of debugging.</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">

VS Code is an extremely full-featured IDE, but is a fairly big program. This is the current IDE of choice of the author of this textbook since it can flexibly work in the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> typesetting language for mathematics as well, if the right extensions are enabled.</div></li>

Thonny actually comes bundled with its own installation of Python and so doesn't require you to download from <a class="external" href="http://python.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">python.org</code></a> at all.</div>
<div class="para">Thonny is actually designed for absolute beginners and is so user-friendly that it is pre-installed in the Raspbian operating system for RaspberryPi microcomputers, often used to teach programming to children. That being said it is still a functional Python IDE.</div>

<li><div class="para">A final alternative, and a strong one, is to sign up for an account at <a class="external" href="http://cocalc.com" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cocalc.com</code></a> and use CoCalc as your development environment. The major caveat here is that you must be online to access your files. This textbook was rewritten on CoCalc!</div></li>
