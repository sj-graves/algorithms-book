<div class="para">Since we see that a little frequency analysis can go a long way towards decryption when we permute characters, we have to consider another method which makes the frequency-analysis approach more difficult. The method known as <dfn class="terminology">Playfair's cipher</dfn> was first developed in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but popularized by Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair, and was in continuous use up through World War II. The principle benefit to Playfair is the simplicity of its execution by hand. At the same time, it shifts the alphabet of the permutation from an alphabet of 26 letters to an alphabet of 600 <dfn class="terminology">digraphs</dfn>. Unfortunately there are certain characteristics of the permutations generated by Playfair's cipher that lend themselves to mathematical analysis.</div>
