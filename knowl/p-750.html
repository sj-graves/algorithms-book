<div class="para">These are just a few of the basic definitions of graph theory. It is a subject which is very appealing for research as the problems are often visually interesting. Since problems in the field are very accessible, some mathematicians are mildly derogatory towards graph theory, calling the field “recreational mathematics.” If that is so, then the vast number of graph theorists are perhaps the luckiest of all mathematicians: their chosen field of research is seen to be fun and games by their colleagues!</div>
