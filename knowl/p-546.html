<div class="para">The two forms of multiplication with a matrix as the multiplier are matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication. In each case, there is a consideration as to the size of the multiplicand as compared to the size of the multiplier, and those sizes will need to be checked during input validation. The only other valid multiplication case occurs when a non-matrix is the multiplier and the matrix is the multiplicand, which only occurs during scalar multiplication; therefore in that case the only constraint is to check that the scalar is in fact a complex number.</div>
