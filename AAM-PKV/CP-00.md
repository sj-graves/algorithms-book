# Class Project 00: Algorithms

Consider the diagram:

![graph](../generated-assets/latex-image/img-smallnetwork.svg)

Let's consider the **vertices** of the graph to be the numbers in the subscript of each circle and the **weights** of the **edges** to be the boxed numbers on each line connecting two circles. Then we can think of the set of vertices mathematically as being

```Python
vertices = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```
