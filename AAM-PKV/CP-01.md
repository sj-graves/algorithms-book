# Class Project 01

It is _very important_ that you actually type the given code in by hand _exactly as it is written_. There are two reasons for this:

1. Attention to detail is a very important difference between people who are good at their job and people who are merely mediocre.
2. Sometimes the point of an exercise will be to fix something which has intentionally been written as broken.

## Organization
These projects will be broken into **Exercises**, which will individually be broken into **Tasks** and those into **Subtasks**, if that level of structure is necessary. Code blocks and commands to be typed on the computer `will look like this`.

## Exercise 1: Setup

These aren't really related to learning to code, they're just getting your "software stack" ready.

### Task 1.1: Text Editor

Any text editor will do. There are a number of good cross-platform editors. Unfortunately, most of them are IDEs: _integrated development environments_. The [most popular among programmers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment) is [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode); for those of us who don't like operating with Microsoft breathing down our necks, there is an alternative version of VS Code which avoids all the yucky Microsoft branding and telemetry: [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). The upside is that these are beautiful text editors. The downside is that it's all too easy to add plugins which oversimplify the process of writing code. We will avoid the use of any plugins which complete code, debug our problems for us, or generally make things too easy.

| Operating System | Options            |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Windows          | VS Code, Notepad++ |
| MacOS            | VS Code, TextEdit  |
| Linux            | VS Code, gedit     |

> _Advanced_: On the off chance that you're using Linux via the command line, you probably don't need any help with this. I suggest using `screen` and your favorite choice of `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`.

Henceforth this program will be called your _editor_.

### Task 1.2: Find the _Terminal_ on your computer

- Windows: the Terminal in Windows is called _PowerShell_
- MacOS: It's called _Terminal_, and it's in _Applications/Utilities_ or something similar.
- Linux: If you are using Linux and can't find the terminal, you probably ought not be using Linux. There are many different terminal programs, and every Linux distribution comes with at least one &mdash; it's the basic multi-user login console.

Whichever one of these options you're using, I will refer to all of them as your _terminal_ and the interface that it provides you access to I will call the _command line_. Commands that will be typed at the command line will look like this:

```bash
$ touch myface
```

The `$` is called the _prompt_. It might look different, often including the path to the current working directory (or at least the name of the current working directory).

#### Subtask 1.2.1

Test to see if `python3` works in your terminal.

```bash
$ python3
```

The response, when Python is correctly installed, should look something like this:

```
Python 3.10.12 (main, Jun 11 2023, 05:26:28) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

If that shows up, type `quit()` and press Enter/Return/&crarr;.

### Task 1.3: Get Python

To get Python for the system you are using, head to [https://python.org](https://python.org) and download _Python 3_, in the latest version number; as of this writing, it is Python 3.11. For most purposes, the version number after 3 won't matter.

### Task 1.4: Working Environment

You're going to want to know how to navigate in the terminal. You should look up on the internet (using DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, or some other privacy-focused search engine) the commands used in your particular operating system for navigating the command line. At the minimum, you'll need to know how to create a new directory (also called a folder) and how to change directories.

Wherever you keep your files (usually a directory called `Documents` or something) create a new directory called `AAM-Python`. Inside that you're going to create another directory for every daily activity.

## Problem 2: Your First Program

Create a directory in your `AAM-Python` directory called `Project-01`. Open your editor and **_type_** the following code:

```Python
# AAM PRJ 01
# My Name Here
print("Hello world!")
print("Hello yourself")
print('Type this exactly the way that I have typed it')
print("Don't change anything, even if you feel 'smart.'")
print("""Sometimes things don't do what you would expect, and\n
\tthat's okay""")
```

Save that as a file named `prj01_01.py` in your `AAM-Python/Project-01` directory. Open your terminal and change directories to your `AAM-Python/Project-01` directory. At the command line, type

```bash
$ python3 prj01_01.py
```

### What You Should See: Expected Output

After running this code through the Python interpreter (that's what happens when you call `python3` with a filename argument), you should see the following output:

```
Hello world!
Hello yourself
Type this exactly the way that I have typed it
Don't change anything, even if you feel 'smart.'
Sometimes things don't do what you would expect, and

	that's okay
```
