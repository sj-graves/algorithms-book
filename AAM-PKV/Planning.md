# Planning

I want to use this to sort of build my flow through what I think should be the in-class component of the AAM course and how that should cohere with the content of the text, particularly as I move forward with trying to make in-class participation part of the actual assessment. Particularly, I want to have daily in-class exercises which count for a grade, but I have to figure out a way to make it so that students are positively encouraged to struggle through the material rather than trying to "get the right answer."

Mostly this desire to change is inspired by the rapid availability of the Chat-GPT suite of tools from OpenAI.

I like the approach of the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project for the Rust programming language: **learn Rust by debugging Rust**.

## Current Flow

1. Welcome
   1. Connecting a Network
   2. Project: Familiarity with Python
2. Permutations
3. Simple Cryptography
   1. Substitution
   2. Other classics
   3. _Project_: Crypto in Python
4. Linear Algebra
   1. Vectors
   2. _Project_: Python Vectors (OOP)
   3. Matrices
   4. _Project_: Python Matrices (OOP)
5. Matrix Applications
   1. Solving SLEs
   2. _Project_: GJE with PP in Python
   3. PA=LU Decomposition
6. Graph Theory Algorithms
   1. Basics
   2. MSTs
   3. Shortest Paths
   4. Max Flow/Min Cut
7. Back Matter
   1. Python Crash Course

## Monico's Ideas

### Weekly (14 or 15, depending upon semester flow)

- half-lecture about a new concept
- simple "practice assignment" to be complete and demonstrated in class, graded at 10% of the grade as a minimal attendance bar to jump
- longer weekly project: "have to find some assemblagee of the tools they have so far to solve the problem; early on, these are pretty straightforward, but by the end they have some slightly more interesting algorithmic issues to think about."

### Particular topic ideas:

- Collatz Problem
- Newton's method "fractals"
- Conway's _Game of Life_

Since these are commonly used examples, give them stubs of class files so that they can't jsut grab code from online.

## Reflow ideas

1. Start with a math problem to make them think "procedurally" about math. I still like "minimum spanning tree" because they might come up with Kruskal's algorithm or Jarnik-Prim.
2. Python Crash Course 1 - basics, data types, loops, conditionals
3. Python Crash Course 2 - functions, OOP, classes & methods
4. Encryption 1 - Kid RSA
5. Encryption 2 - One Time Pads (XOR)
6. Matrix arithmetic
7. Gauss Jordan Elimination using Multiplication by Elementary Matrices
8. ???
