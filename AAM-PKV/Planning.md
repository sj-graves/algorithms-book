# Planning

I want to use this to sort of build my flow through what I think should be the in-class component of the AAM course and how that should cohere with the content of the text, particularly as I move forward with trying to make in-class participation part of the actual assessment. Particularly, I want to have daily in-class exercises which count for a grade, but I have to figure out a way to make it so that students are positively encouraged to struggle through the material rather than trying to "get the right answer."

Mostly this desire to change is inspired by the rapid availability of the Chat-GPT suite of tools from OpenAI.

I like the approach of the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project for the Rust programming language: **learn Rust by debugging Rust**.
