    <title>Quadrature</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Geometry has been well-understood for thousands of years, but there are certain intractable problems in regular Euclidean geometry. One intractable problem was the problem of quadrature.

        <conjecture><title>The quadrature problem</title>
            <statement>
                Given a geometric figure, it is possible to construct a square with equal area.
            </statement>
        </conjecture>
        <p>
            Quadrature seems perfectly reasonable, but is provably the case that with a straight-edge and compass (the two tools of the classical geometer) it is impossible to construct a square with area equal to a given circle; and yet, we all know that the area of the circle of radius <m>r</m> is <m>A=\pi r^2.</m> How is it that we can arrive at this, even in approximation?

            For the sake of simplicity, we'll consider that the basic problem is to compute the area of the quarter of the unit disk in the first quadrant; that is, the region <m>R</m> bounded by the lines <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m> along with the curve <m>y=\sqrt{1-x^2}</m> on the interval <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m>. This will give us the answer to the classical problem of squaring the circle.

            Rectangles are <em>not</em> the only plane figures of which we can determine the area: in fact, since we know the area of a triangle and all rectilinear plane figures can be triangulated, we can find the area of every polygon as a sum of triangular areas. In fact, we'll use trapezoidal regions to approximate the area under the curve. This is a well-balanced balanced approximation, since the trapezoid has as its area <m>A=\frac12(b_1+b_2) h</m>, which is <m>A = \frac12(b_1h+b_2h)</m> the average of two rectangular areas.
