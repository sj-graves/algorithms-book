    <title>Cycles and disjoint cycle decomposition</title>
    <p>
        There is another method of writing permutations which is preferred for group theory as it makes several special characteristics of permutations very visible.

                Suppose <m>a\in A</m> and <m>\sigma\in S_A</m>. Then <term><m>\sigma</m> fixes <m>a</m></term>, or equivalently <m>a</m> is a <term>fixed point of <m>\sigma</m></term>, if and only if <m>\sigma(a)=a</m>. Elements of <m>A</m> which are not fixed by <m>\sigma</m> are <term>moved</term> by <m>\sigma</m>.

    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r</m> be distinct integers in <m>[n]</m>, where <m>n\geq r</m>. Suppose <m>\alpha\in S_n</m> fixes all integers in <m>[n]\setminus\set{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_r}</m> and also that
                <me>
                    \alpha(i_1)=i_2, \alpha(i_2)=i_3, \ldots \alpha(i_{r-1})=i_r, \alpha(i_r)=i_1.
                </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Then <m>\alpha</m> is an <term><m>r</m>-cycle</term>, or equivalently a <term>cycle of length <m>r</m></term>, and is denoted in <term>cycle notation</term> by
                <me>
                    \alpha = (i_1~i_2~\cdots~i_r).
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        An interesting result of the definition of cycles is that every <m>1</m>-cycle is equivalent to the identity: if <m>a\in[n]</m> and <m>\alpha=(a)</m>, then <m>\alpha(a) = a</m> and for all <m>b\in[n]\setminus\set{a}</m>, <m>b</m> is fixed by <m>\alpha</m>, so <m>\alpha(b)=b</m>. Thus <m>(a)=e</m> for any <m>a\in[n]</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Two cycles <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are <term>disjoint</term> if and only if every element moved by <m>\alpha</m> is fixed by <m>\beta</m> and every element moved by <m>\beta</m> is fixed by <m>\alpha</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <lemma>
        <statement>
            <p>
                If <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are disjoint cycles in <m>S_n</m>, then <m>\alpha\beta=\beta\alpha</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </lemma>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_cycdecomp">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Every permutation is either a cycle or a product of disjoint cycles.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
        Moreover, this decomposition into disjoint cycles can be written uniquely up to the order in which the cycles appear!
    </p>

    <example>
        <title>Writing a permutation in disjoint cycle notation</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider 
                <me>
                    g = \verb|8 1 5 9 4 6 7 3 10 2|.
                </me>
                We can write the cycle decomposition of <m>g</m> by starting with <m>1</m>: the first cycle of the decomposition will be 
                <m>(1,g(1),g^2(1),g^3(1),\cdots,g^s(1))</m> for some <m>s\leq n</m>. In fact,
                <md>
                    <mrow>
                        1 \mapsto 8 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 5 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 9 \mapsto 10 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 1
                    </mrow>
                </md>
                completes a cycle, and we also can see that <m>g(6)=6</m> and <m>g(7)=7</m>. Hence the disjoint cycle notation for <m>g</m> is
                <me>
                    g = (1,8,3,5,4,9,10,2)
                </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                While cycle notation is useful for many purposes, some find it difficult to multiply permutations written in their cycle decompositions. A rule to follow is this: the <q>motion</q> of symbols is evaluated from the right to the left. In order to discover the value of <m>g^2</m>, we write
                <me>
                    g^2 = (1,8,3,5,4,9,10,2)(1,8,3,5,4,9,10,2)
                </me>
                and proceeding from right to left, we find that 
                <md>
                    <mrow>
                        1\mapsto 8 \amp\mapsto 3, \amp 
                        3\mapsto 5 \amp\mapsto 4, \amp
                        4\mapsto 9 \amp\mapsto 10, \amp
                        10\mapsto 2 \amp\mapsto 1 \amp
                    </mrow>
                    <intertext>and</intertext>
                    <mrow>
                        2\mapsto 1 \amp\mapsto 8, \amp
                        8\mapsto 3 \amp\mapsto 5, \amp
                        5\mapsto  \amp\mapsto 8, \amp
                        2\mapsto 1 \amp\mapsto 8. \amp
                    </mrow>
                </md>
                Hence
                <me>
                    g^2 = (1,3,4,10)(2,8,5,9).
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also compute powers of a permutation from its cycle decomposition by <q>skipping</q> through the cycles. For instance, rather than discovering <m>g^3</m> by calculating <m>g\cdot g^2</m>, we can recognize that the image of 1 under <m>g^3</m> must be the third number after 1 in the cyclic notation for <m>g</m>. Hence

                    <mrow>
                        g^3 \amp = (1,5,10,8,4,2,3,9), \amp g^4 \amp = (1,4)(2,5)(3,10)(8,9),
                    </mrow>
                    <mrow>
                        g^5 \amp = (1,9,3,2,4,8,10,5), \amp g^6 \amp = (1,10,4,3)(2,9,5,8),
                    </mrow>
                    <mrow>
                        g^7 \amp = (1,2,10,9,4,5,3,8), \text{\,and} \amp g^8 \amp = e.

        We are now equipped to see the real beauty of the cycle decomposition of a permutation.

                Suppose <m>\sigma\in S_A</m> and <m>\sigma=\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_k</m> is its cycle decomposition. Then
                <me>
                    \abs{\sigma}=\lcm\set{\abs{\alpha_i}:i\in[k]}.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Another beauty of cycle notation is that we see the behavior of certain powers of a permutation quite clearly. For example, if we let
                <me>
                    \phi=(1~3~7~5)(2~4~6~8~9),
                </me>
                we can write <m>\alpha=(1~3~7~5)</m> and <m>\beta=(2~4~6~8~9)</m>. Then <m>\abs{\alpha}=4</m> and <m>\abs{\beta}=5</m>, and
                <me>
                    \phi^5 = \alpha^5\beta^5 = \alpha^4\alpha e=\alpha
                </me>
                and
                <me>
                    \phi^4 = \alpha^4\beta^4 = e\beta^{4} = \beta^{-1}.
                </me>
