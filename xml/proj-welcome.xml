                We're going to introduce all the coding structure you'll need for the whole semester, right now.

            <title>Working with variables</title>
            <p>
                Mathematically speaking a variable is a symbolic representation -- sometimes of a numerical quantity, sometimes an algebraic concept, other times simply a symbol. As a programmer, variables are similar: symbolic values to which is assigned some value. Value is assigned in Sage by a single equal sign.

                <input>
                    text = "Bob is a hooker"
                    print text
