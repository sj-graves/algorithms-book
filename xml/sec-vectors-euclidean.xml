            <statement>
                The <em>length</em> of a vector <m>\vec{x}</m> is a unique scalar associated with <m>\vec{x}</m> denoted by <m>\abs{\vec{x}}</m>.

        <p>
            In compass-and-straight-edge geometry, there is no way to calculate the length of a vector, but it is possible to determine whether two vectors have the same length. The existence of a coordinate system (<em>Cartesian coordinates</em>, for example) allows us to define a formula for the length of a Euclidean vector.

                The length of a vector <me>\vec{x}=\vc{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n}\in\R^n</me> is given by <me>\norm{\vec{x}} = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2}.</me>

        Vectors in the Euclidean plane and in Euclidean 3-space are generally represented as arrows with a <em>tail</em> at one point and a <em>head</em> at another. Two arrows in the plane represent <em>equivalent vectors</em> if the arrows lie along parallel lines, have the same length, and point in the same respective direction along each of their respective lines. The <em>zero vector</em>, which is the unique vector of length 0, is represented as a point at the origin.

        <title>Geometric operations</title>
        <p>
            The two operations which are necessary to turn a set of <m>n</m>-tuples into a <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space are <em>addition</em> and <em>scalar multiplication</em>, which are both demonstrated easily using geometric vectors.

            <title>Geometric vector addition</title>
            <p>
                To add two vectors <m>\vec{x}</m> and <m>\vec{y}</m> geometrically, we begin by drawing both as arrows, with the tail of each at the origin. We then draw an equivalent vector to <m>\vec{x}</m> with its tail at the head of <m>\vec{y}</m> and an equivalent vector to <m>\vec{y}</m> with its tail at the head of <m>\vec{x}</m>. These four vectors will form the sides of a parallelogram; the diagonal arrow with its tail at the origin and its head at the opposite corner of the parallelogram is the vector sum <m>\vec{x}+\vec{y}</m>.

            <title>Geometric scaling of vectors</title>
            <p>
                The geometric scaling of a vector is actually the source of the term <em>scalar</em>; given a vector <m>\vec{x}</m> and a constant <m>k</m>, the scalar multiple of <m>\vec{x}</m> by <m>k</m> is the vector <m>k\vec{x}</m> with <m>\abs{k\vec{x}}=k\abs{\vec{x}}</m>, whose direction is the same as <m>\vec{x}</m> if <m>k\gt 0</m> and whose direction is opposite <m>\vec{x}</m> when <m>k\lt 0</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It should be clear that <m>0\vec{x}=\vec{0}</m> is the zero vector for every <m>\vec{x}</m>.

        <title>Linear transformations in Euclidean geometry</title>
        <p>
            You can think of a linear transformation geometrically by considering the <em>unit square</em>, or its higher dimensional equivalent; the images of each of the <em>standard basis vectors</em>
