            To really begin life as a programmer you only need to understand a few essentials, and everything else builds from these. The basic ideas are how to store more than one piece of related data at a time (containers), how to make decisions based upon the value of variables (conditionals) and how to repeat processes (iteration), and how to make this repeatable for a variety of input data (functional programming). 
        </p>
        <p>
            We add here a section on <q>comprehension</q>, a Python programming technique which combines containers, conditionals, and iteration into a power tool for modern programming.
