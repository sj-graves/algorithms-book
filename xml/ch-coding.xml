            To really begin life as a programmer you only need to understand a few essentials, and everything else builds from these. Here's a list of the basics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <term>Containers</term> are used to store more than one item of data at a time;
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Flow control</term> is how a program changes the order of execution based upon the values of variables (conditioning) and in order to repeat simpler tasks (iteration);
            </li>
            <li>
                <term>Functions</term> are used by a program to encapsulate tasks which are useful for a variety of different,
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We also add a section on <term>comprehension</term>, a Python programming technique which combines containers, conditionals, and iteration into a power tool for modern programming.
