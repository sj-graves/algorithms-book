    <title>List comprehension</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Suppose you had a list <c>foo</c> of numbers, and you wanted to set <c>bar</c> equal to the list of their squares. We could easily perform this task with a for loop and the <c>append</c> list method, which adds the argument to the end of the list.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                foo = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
                bar = []
                for x in foo:
                    bar.append(x^2)
                print bar
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            However, Sage provides a much more elegant way to do the same thing, called <em>list comprehension</em>. Essentially this provides a way to create a list by successively performing the same operation (in this case squaring) on all the elements of another list.

        <sage>
            <input>
                foo = [1,3,5,7,9]
                bar = [x^2 for x in foo]
                print bar
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            This is a trivial example; here's an example which is more interesting.

            <title>Approximating Integrals</title>
            <p> 
                While we know from Calculus that the best way to calculate the area between a curve <m>\set{(x,f(x)):a\leq x\leq b, f(x)\geq 0}</m> is to use the definite integral <m>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx</m>, we also know that <me>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x_i.</me>
                We can quickly approximate the Riemann sum on the right using lists and list comprehensions; leveraging the power of Sage as a full symbolic mathematics system, we can even go so far as to easily draw the approximating rectangles where <m>x_i^* = x_i</m>.

        <p> <em>Nested list comprehension</em> is a very important tool for producing "legible code" in Sage or Python, because it provides a way to remove nested for loops. Compare the following two programs which result in identical output.

        <sage>
            <input>
                foo = []
                for i in range(10):
                bar = []
                for j in range(i):
                bar.append(j^2)
                foo.append(bar)
