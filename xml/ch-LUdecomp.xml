            We often talk about square matrices in the context of systems of linear equations because a system of fewer than <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> unknowns is <em>underqualified</em>; that is, there are too few equations to give a unique solution in all variables. On the other hand, systems of more than <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> variables either have redundant equations (at least one equations is a linear combination of the others) or the system is <em>overqualified</em> and an inconsistent system. Thus <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> unknowns is the sort of ``happy medium" of having enough equations for unique solutions without having too many for a solution to exist.

            When we discuss systems of linear equations, we are generally most concerned with systems which have exactly the same number of equations given as there are unknown variables. This is for good reasons. A linear system with fewer equations than unknowns is <em>underqualified</em>, which means that it is impossible to find a unique vector solution to the system. On the other hand, a linear system with more equations than variable is <em>overqualified</em>, meaning that it is unlikely to find even one vector which satisfies all of the given equations. Square matrices, which represent the happy medium between these two extremes, are the perfect place to look for linear systems with unique solutions.
