    <title>Network flows</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We can extend the idea of a weighted graph from the preceding chapter even further. Rather than simply considering a weight on an arrow of a directed graph to be a cost or distance, we can consider it as a <em>carrying capacity</em> of the edge; for example, think of the maximum bandwidth of a network connection. While a particular use of the network may not require the full bandwidth, it is certainly the case that the flow of traffic on that connection cannot exceed the bandwidth.
