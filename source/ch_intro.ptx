    <introduction>
        <p>
            Algorithms for Applied Mathematics (AAM) has one purpose: to introduce students to enough algorithm design and practical coding experience that they will be able to use simple codes in an attempt to solve <q>non-routine problems.</q> Unfortunately, what exactly constitutes a <q>non-routine problem</q> is open to exploration, and most problems which can be described in a simple way are fairly routine. The power of algorithmic thinking is that very simple tools can be combined in subtle ways to provide insight into complicated problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            We begin with a classic problem from graph theory which demonstrates exactly this idea.
