    <title>Linear Algebra</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In keeping with our study of <em>permutations as functions</em> we shift now to a different class of special functions: linear transformations. The study of linear transformations is so special that it deserves its own discipline of mathematics, called <term>Linear Algebra</term>. Since most students who study Algorithms come in via a program which requires some other study of linear algebra, the theoretical parts of this chapter will serve either as an abbreviated introduction or as a brief reminder.
