    <p>
      Thank you to the University of Texas at Tyler students of Math 3380: Algorithms for Applied Mathematics. You were my guinea pigs as I initially drafted this manuscript as lecture notes, and as I have continued to massage the text over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, thank you to Rob Beezer, who made possible the conversion of this book to Mathbook XML, and to David Farmer, who used his excellent S2LX script to bulk-convert the original <latex />
 source to Mathbook XML, which morphed into PreTeXt.
    </p>
