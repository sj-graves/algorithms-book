### S. J. Graves

Some simple facts: first and foremost, the students coming into this class are three populations. 
1. Computer science majors who are opting to take the class as an elective
2. Upper division math majors who have avoided the class or are retaking it
3. New students who are taking the course parallel to Calc II or otherwise early in their mathematical careers.
