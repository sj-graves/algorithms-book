# Algorithms for Applied Math
## 2021-2022 Revision

As often is the case, I'm working on revising the AAM text. The hope is to make the text (and the course) more attractive to those learning to code for the first time, and provide a lower barrier to entry to (a)  new math majors who haven't yet taken 3425, etc., and (b) students who have little to no coding experience. Simultaneously, I want to make the text more attractive as a resource to students who have programmed previously but have little exposure to interesting mathematical algorithms.
