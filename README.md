# Algorithms for Applied Math
## 2021-2022 Revision

The current version of the text after the 2021-2022 revision is substantially different from the old version, and focused on a project-centric approach to learning. As currently written it is compiled using version 1.3.0 of the PreTeXt-CLI. Please see [Section 5.2: The PreTeXt-CLI](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/processing-CLI.html#processing-CLI) of [The PreTeXt Guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/guide-toc.html) for more details.

```bash
pip install pretext
pip install pretext --upgrade
python -m pretext generate all
python -m pretext build html
```

There is likely a future revision in the works. Stay tuned for the IMPaRT revision to AAM!
