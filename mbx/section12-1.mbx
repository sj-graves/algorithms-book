A <term>graph</term> is an ordered pair <m>\Gamma=(V,E)</m>, where <m>V</m> is a set of <term>vertices</term> and <m>E</m> is a set of <term>edges</term>, where edges are unordered pairs of distinct vertices. That is,
<me>
  E \subseteq \set{\set{u,v}:u,v\in V}.
</me>
</p>

<p>
In order to simplify notation, we will write <m>uv</m> instead of <m>\set{u,v}</m> for an edge.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<remark>
<p>
There are many, many different formulations for the definition of a graph. Some definitions are suffiently relaxed that an edge can loop back from a vertex to itself <mdash /> these are generally called <em>loops</em>. Likewise, edges can be defined as independent objects with <em>endpoints</em>, which allows for more than one edge to have vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> as endpoints. I make the distinction that graphs which have loops or multiple edges are <em>multipgraphs</em>. Some mathematicians are even more relaxed: their edges can contain more than two vertices, and the resulting structure is a <em>hypergraph</em>!

Two graphs <m>\Gamma=(V,E)</m> and <m>\Gamma'=(V',E')</m> are <term>isomorphic</term> if there is a function <m>\phi:V\to V'</m> such that the following three conditions hold.
<ol>

Suppose <m>\Gamma=(V,E)</m> is a graph and <m>u,v\in V</m>. A <term>path</term> between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is any sequence

These are just a few of the ``basic definitions" of graph theory. It is a subject which is very appealing for research as the problems are often visually interesting. Since problems in the field are very accessible, some mathematicians are mildly derogatory towards graph theory, calling the field ``recreational mathematics." If that is so, then the vast number of graph theorists are perhaps the luckiest of all mathematicians: their chosen field of research is seen to be fun and games by their colleagues!
</p>

<p>
All joking aside, graph theory and the larger discipline of combinatorics are deeply applicable fields. There are many ``real world" problems which are modeled by discrete systems (rather than continuous systems such as used in differential equations or traditional applied math courses), and graph theory techniques are often the best solution to these problems. So while combinatorics is not generally considered part of applied mathematics, it is very <em>applicable</em> mathematics.
