<title>Permutation groups</title>
<p>
Since permutations of a set <m>A</m> are bijections from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>, they can be composed.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose <m>\sigma,\tau\in S_A</m> for some set <m>A</m>. Then the composition of <m>\tau</m> after <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation <m>\tau\circ\sigma:A\to A</m> defined by
<me>
  (\tau\circ\sigma)(a) = \tau(\sigma(a))
</me>
for each <m>a\in A</m>. Moreover, the composition symbol <m>\circ</m> will be suppressed, and we will write <m>\tau\sigma</m> as a product rather than a composition<fn>This is familiar: think of <m>f(x) = \arctan\cos(x)</m>.</fn>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Two-line notation makes calculating the composition of permutations uncomplicated, if the permutations are ``stacked" in the correct order.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Consider <m>\sigma_1</m> and <m>\sigma_2</m> from Example 9.3. To determine the product <m>\sigma_2\sigma_1</m>, we write <m>\sigma_1</m> first and then <m>\sigma_2</m> below it, in two-line notation. The output of <m>\sigma_1</m> then becomes the input of <m>\sigma_2</m>, as demonstrated below by an arrow.

<p>
If each possible such arrow is followed, the result can be tabulated in the two-line notation for <m>\sigma_2\sigma_1</m>,

.
As a memory aid the product <m>\sigma_2\sigma_1</m> should be read as <q><m>\sigma_2</m> of <m>\sigma_1</m>,</q> rather that ``<m>\sigma_2</m> times <m>\sigma_1</m>," much as with fractions: <m>\frac32(15)</m> can be read as ``three halves of fifteen."
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Next we know from elementary calculus that a function which is one-to-one must have an inverse.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose <m>\sigma\in S_A</m>. Then there is a unique {inverse} for <m>\sigma</m>, denoted <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>, such that <m>\sigma^{-1}\sigma = e_A = \sigma\sigma^{-1}.</m>
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
We need to note that composition is <em>not commutative</em>. Generally speaking, <m>\sigma\tau\neq\tau\sigma</m>. To demonstrate, observe

.
Clearly <m>\sigma_1\sigma_2\neq \sigma_2\sigma_1</m>, since two permutations can only be equal if they have the same two-line notation.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Composition of permutations satisfies another desirable property: it is associative. That is, <m>\sigma(\tau\phi) = (\sigma\tau)\phi</m>.
</p>
<definition>
<statement>
<p>
A set <m>G</m> along with an associative operation <m>*</m> which is closed under inverses and has an identity element is a <term>group</term>. The set <m>S_A</m> with composition is thus called the <term>symmetric group over <m>A</m></term>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<remark>
<p>
In fact, the study of group theory (which begins for modern students in Math 3336) was inspired by the work of Lagrange on generalizations of permutation groups. An important result in group theory, especially for those working with groups in an applied setting, is <em>Cayley's Theorem</em>: every abstract group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group.<fn>Don't worry about ``isomorphic." If two groups are said to be isomorphic, you can just think that each group is a ``creative relabelling" of the other.</fn>
