    <introduction>
        <p>
            Up to this point, we have only discussed small, stand-alone pieces of code. While these can be useful, it is much more likely that you will have a computational task which you need to use repeatedly - otherwise, you would more likely just work out the solution to whatever problem you are investigating by hand. The desire to reuse pieces of code gives rise to <em>functional programming.</em> Just as a mathematicial who often needs to use the expression <m>x^2+2x+2</m> for varying values of <m>x</m> will define a mathematical function <m>f(x)=x^2+2x+2</m>, a programmer will define a function to repeatedly perform the same small standalone code.

            In this chapter we will investigate the two ways that functions are generally defined in Sage, how functions and data objects are often combined into modules called <em>classes</em>, and how we can use function and class definitions to redefine standard operators used in other contexts. Further, we will begin to discuss the utility of saving your Sage code in <c>.sage</c> files to be loaded in other programs, rather than only working in the interactive Sage notebook.
