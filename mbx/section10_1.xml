<title>Simple substitution</title>


<introduction>
<p>
Also called <em>monoalphabetic substitution</em>, these are among the easiest encryptions to break. A simple substitution cipher employs a single permutation of the symbol set to encrypt the plaintext. The <em>Caesar cipher</em> is one of the earliest known uses: in an alphabet of size <m>n</m>, the permutation for Julius Caesar's cipher was <m>\sigma(x) = (x+3)\mod n</m>. For Caesar's military dispatches, the permutation would have been

Since <m>26\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>, this permutation <m>\sigma_1</m> would be written as a single <m>26</m>-cycle in disjoint cycle notation.

Generally speaking, we'll call an encryption of this type either a <em>shift cipher</em> or a <em>rotation cipher</em>; another frequently used rotation cipher is called ``ROT13," and is given by

Since ROT13 is an involution<fn>A permutation <m>\sigma</m> is an involution if and only if <m>\sigma^2=(1)</m>.</fn>, it is used as the canonical example of weak encryption; it was commonly used online in usenet newsgroups during the early 1980s to obscure text such as ``spoilers," punchlines to jokes, or obscene language.

<title>Polygraphic substitution</title>
<p>
Another more secure technique is to permute groups of letters, effectively increasing the size of the alphabet. A digraph encryption would take pairs of adjacent letters (<em>digraphs</em>) and permute them with another digraph.
</p>

<p>
In the Playfair cipher<fn>Developed in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone but advocated by Lord Playfair.</fn> a <m>5\times 5</m> grid of letters containing a keyword is memorized, along with four rules. The keyword is written into the grid, with duplicate letters removed, and the remaining letters follow. The letters <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are written into the same position. For instance, if our key phrase is ``TALONS UP," the grid would be

<latex-image-code><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1/3]
\draw \foreach \y/\x/\z in {4/0/T,  4/1/A,  4/2/L,  4/3/O,  4/4/N,  3/0/S,  3/1/U,  3/2/P,  3/3/B,  3/4/C,  2/0/D,  2/1/E,  2/2/F,  2/3/G,  2/4/H,  1/0/IJ,  1/1/K,  1/2/M,  1/3/Q,  1/4/R,  0/0/V,  0/1/W,  0/2/X,  0/3/Y,  0/4/Z}{
    (\x+.5,\y+.5) node {\z}
};\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image-code>

<p>
.
The rules are
<ol>
<li><p>If the paired letters are the same, insert an <m>X</m> between them.</p></li>
<li><p>If the letters occur in the same row of the table, use the letters to their immediate right, wrapping around to the left side of the table if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>If the letters occur in the same column of the table, use the letters immediately below them, wrapping around to the top of the table if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, draw a rectangle around the pair of letters, and replace each with the unused corner from the same row.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
These rules are only difficult to formulate in writing, but in practice are easy to implement; the inventor claimed he could teach it to 3 out of 4 school boys in 15 minutes. To demonstrate the use of the cipher, we'll use our Playfair grid to encrypt the message, <c>HIT THE BOOKKEEPER</c>. First, we break the plaintext into pairs, inserting <m>X</m>'s where necessary:
<me>
  \texttt{HITTHEBOOKKEEPER}\mapsto \texttt{HI~T\underline{X}~TH~EB~O\underline{X}~OK~KE~EP~ER}
</me>

Next we draw the appropriate boxes, as demonstrated in <xref ref="fig_playfair_exmp" autoname="yes" />.

The resulting plaintext is <c>DRLVN DGULY AQWKF UHK</c>, broken into 5-character blocks. To decrypt the message is to use the same Playfair grid and reverse rules 2, 3, and 4. Unfortunately, the use of this digraph substitution remains equivalent to a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, this time on an alphabet of <m>26\cdot 25 = 650</m> symbols, since no double-letter digraphs are permuted. Since <m>\log_{10}(650!)\approx 1547.91</m>, this is a considerably large space of permutations to attack naively.
