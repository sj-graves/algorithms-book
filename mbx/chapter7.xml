<remark>
<p>
We often talk about square matrices in the context of systems of linear equations because a system of fewer than <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> unknowns is <em>underqualified</em>; that is, there are too few equations to give a unique solution in all variables. On the other hand, systems of more than <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> variables either have redundant equations (at least one equations is a linear combination of the others) or the system is <em>overqualified</em> and an inconsistent system. Thus <m>n</m> equations in <m>n</m> unknowns is the sort of ``happy medium" of having enough equations for unique solutions without having too many for a solution to exist.
