<title>Elementary matrices</title>


<introduction>
<p>
Suppose there is a matrix <m>A</m>, and some sequence of row operations transforms it into <m>A'</m>, so that <m>A\to A'</m>. What happens if we assume that there is some matrix <m>E</m> such that <m>EA=A'</m>? Assuming that such an <m>E</m> exists, what can we say about it?
</p>

<p>
It makes sense to think that nothing is special about the matrix <m>A</m> when performing a row operation; for instance, <m>-2R_1+R_3</m> always produces elements <m>a_{3,j}-2a_{1,j}</m> in the third row, no matter what the values of <m>a_{i,j}</m> are. So we should think that if <m>E</m> corresponds to a particular elementary row operation, then left-multiplying <em>any</em> matrix of the correct dimensions by <m>E</m> will have the proper result. Further, <m>EI = E</m>, so we know that whatever effect a row operation has on the identity matrix results in the elementary matrix itself!
</p>
</introduction>


<subsection>
<title>Row swaps</title>
<p>
Consider then the result on the <m>4\times 4</m> identity matrix of having rows <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> swapped.
<me>
  \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1
\end{bmatrix}  \xto{R_1:R_3} 
	\begin{bmatrix}0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1
\end{bmatrix} .
</me>
</p>

<p>
Hence the matrix corresponding to interchanging rows <m>k</m> and <m>\ell</m> must be the matrix with 0s in all entries except for 1s when <m>i=j</m> and <m>i\neq k</m>, <m>i\neq \ell</m>, and <m>a_{k,\ell}=a_{\ell,k}=1</m>. That is, <m>E=[e_{i,j}]</m> with
<me>
  e_{i,j} = \begin{cases}1, \amp  i=j\text{ and } i,j\notin\set{k,\ell}\text{ , or } i\neq j\text{ and } i,j\in\set{k,\ell} \\
	0, \amp  \text{ otherwise } .
\end{cases}
</me>
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<title>Scalar multiplication of a row</title>
<p>
Again, operating on the <m>4\times 4</m> identity matrix gives insight to the structure of this elementary matrix:
<me>
  \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1
\end{bmatrix}  \xto{2R_4} 
	\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  2
\end{bmatrix} .
</me>
</p>

<p>
Hence the <m>n\times n</m> matrix which corresponds to multiplying row <m>k</m> by a scalar <m>\lambda</m> is the matrix <m>E=[e_{i,j}]</m> where
<me>
  e_{i,j} = \begin{cases}1, \amp  i=j\text{ and }  i\neq k\\
	\lambda, \amp  i=j=k \\
	0, \amp \text{ otherwise. } 
\end{cases}
</me>
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<title>Adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row</title>
<p>
Once again, consider the <m>4\times 4</m> identity matrix:
<me>
  \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1
\end{bmatrix}  \xto{9R_4+R_2} 
	\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  9 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  1
\end{bmatrix} .
</me>
</p>

<p>
Hence the <m>n\times n</m> matrix which corresponds to adding to each column of row <m>\ell</m> the scalar multiple <m>\lambda</m> times the corresponding column of row <m>k</m> (<m>\lambda R_k+R_{\ell}</m>) is the matrix <m>E=[e_{i,j}]</m> where
<me>
  e_{i,j} = \begin{cases}1, \amp  i=j \\
	\lambda, \amp  i=\ell\text{ and } j=k\\
	0, \amp \text{ otherwise } .
\end{cases}
</me>
</p>

<p>
Note there that the value <m>\lambda</m> appears in the row {being added to} and in the column corresponding to the row which is {being multiplied}.
</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose that <m>A</m> is a <m>n\times n</m> matrix and that there is some sequence of elementary row operations by which <m>A</m> can be transformed into <m>I</m>, the <m>n\times n</m> identity matrix. Then there is a sequence <m>(E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_k)</m> of elementary matrices such that
<me>
  E_kE_{k-1}\cdots E_2E_1A=I.
