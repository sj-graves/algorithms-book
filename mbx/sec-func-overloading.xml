<title>Power tool: operator overloading</title>


<introduction>
<p>
Operator overloading is easy for a human and hard for a computer. A person can immediately see the symbol <c>+</c> and know from the context how to interpret it. For instance, we can immediately understand that there is a difference between ``<m>3+5</m>" and ``Alice + Bob." A computer has to be told how to handle each of them separately! This is handled by <em>overloading</em> the operator of <c>+</c>. Python does this behind the curtain. Every data type for which <c>+</c> makes sense must have in its class definition a method called <c>__add__</c>. In fact, usually it is implemented as <c>def __add__(self, other):</c>, and then the return value is <c>self + other</c>. It is generally also smart to define a <c>__radd__</c> method to return <c>other + self</c>, and for numerical quantities they should be equal<fn>Addition is almost universally a commutative operation.</fn>.

<title>Complex addition</title>
<p>
What is the algorithm for complex addition? That is, if I defined <m>x=a+ib</m> and <m>y=c+id</m> for some <m>a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}</m>, what does it mean to write <m>x+y</m>? If we treat <m>x=a+ib</m> and <m>y=c+id</m> as polynomials in variable <m>i</m> with real coefficients, we can use the rules for polynomials and obtain
<md>
  <mrow>  x + y \amp  = (a+ib) + (c+id)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = a+c+ib+id</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =(a+c) + i(b+d).</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Since it makes sense for complex numbers and real numbers to follow the same rules, this is a sensible definition for the algorithm of addition.
</p>
<algorithm>
<p>
(Complex Addition)
Let <c>x</c> be a <c>ComplexNumber</c> with representation <c>(a,b)</c> and let <c>y</c> be some other variable.
<ol>
<li><p>If <c>y</c> is a <c>ComplexNumber</c> with representation <c>(c,d)</c>, return 
 <c>ComplexNumber(a + c, b + d)</c>.</p></li>
<li><p>If not, but <c>y</c> is either an <c>int</c> or a <c>float</c>, return 
 <c>ComplexNumber(a + y, b)</c>.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, raise a <c>TypeError</c>.</p></li>
</ol>

</p>
</algorithm>
<p>
For complex numbers, we update <c>les4_ex2.py</c> as follows to implement addition and right addition.
</p>
<pre>
from math import sqrt

class ComplexNumber:
    ...
    def __add__(self,other):
        if type(other)==type(self):
            return ComplexNumber(self.real_part + other.re(),
                                 self.imag_part + other.im())
        elif type(other) in [type(1), type(0.1)]:
            return ComplexNumber(other + self.real_part, self.imag_part)

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(other)
</pre>
</subsection>


<subsection>
<title>Complex Multiplication</title>
<p>
Complex multiplication, like complex addition, follows naturally from the behavior of polynomials with real coefficients. Again letting <m>x=a+ib</m> and <m>y=c+id</m> be complex numbers, we see that
<md>
  <mrow>  xy \amp = (a+ib)(c+id)</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = ac +ibc +iad + i^2bd</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = (ac-bd)+i(bc+ad).</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
If it so happens that <m>d=0</m>, then <m>xy = ac+ibc</m>. Again, we can use this to determine the algorithm for complex multiplication.
</p>
<algorithm>
<p>
(Complex Multiplication) Let <c>x</c> be a <c>ComplexNumber</c> with representation <c>(a,b)</c> and let <c>y</c> be some other variable.
<ol>
<li><p>If <c>y</c> is a <c>ComplexNumber</c>, return 

	<c>ComplexNumber(a * c - b * d, a * d + b * c)</c></p></li>
<li><p>If not, but <c>y</c> is either an <c>int</c> or a <c>float</c>, return

	<c>ComplexNumber(a*y, b*y)</c></p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, raise a <c>TypeError</c>.</p></li>
</ol>

</p>
</algorithm>
<p>
To implement this is similar to the implementation of addition: there are builtin operators for both left and right multiplication (which is important since multiplication is often not commutative) which can be overloaded, named <c>__mul__</c> and <c>__rmul__</c>. Including them, here is the final, full version of <c>les4_ex2.py</c>.

<title>Overloading other operators</title>
<p>
There are many, many operators and methods which you will want to overload to make robust classes. In fact, almost everything can be overloaded if you can determine how Python handles an operator behind the scenes. For numerical data types, there's an easy way to see what the ``normal" operators are: type <c>help(float)</c> and read the documentation for the <c>float</c> class! In fact, you can often inherit methods from ``parent" classes if the operations are already correct.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>``It's a trap!"</title>
<p>
In fact, we didn't need to do any of this work to implement complex numbers. Try <c>help(complex)</c>. Following a convention from engineering and the sciences, <m>j=\sqrt{-1}</m>, and entering <c>z = 5_3j</c> produces a complex number with full functionality. We won't be saving our <c>ComplexNumber</c> class for further use.
