<title>Max flow</title>
<p>
In nearly every application, the desire is to maximize the flow from <m>s</m> to <m>t</m> across the network; since what is flowing across most networks is not a physical fluid, the problem of maximizing flow is discrete-mathematical rather than a problem of physics solved by differential equations.
</p>
<definition>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose <m>\Delta = (V,E,s,t)</m> is a directed graph with <term>source vertex</term> <m>s</m> and <term>target vertex</term> <m>t</m>. A <term>capacity function</term> <m>c:E\to\R^+</m> for <m>\Delta</m> is the maximum amount of flow which can pass across an edge; this is denoted <m>c(u,v)</m> for the directed edge <m>uv\in E</m>. A <term>flow function</term> <m>f:E\to \R^+</m> for <m>\Delta</m> is a function satisfying the following two constraints:
<ol>
<li><p>(Capacity Constraint) <m>f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)</m> for all <m>uv\in E</m>, and</p></li>
<li><p>(Conservation of Flow) for each <m>v\in V\setminus\set{s,t}</m>,
<me>
  \sum_{uv\in E}f(u,v) = \sum_{vu\in E}f(v,u).
</me></p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The <term>value of flow</term> for a flow function <m>f</m> is defined by
<me>
  \abs{f} = \sum_{v\in V}f(s,v) .
</me>
</p>

<p>
Generally, we wish to maximize the value <m>\abs{f}</m> over all possible flows.

Suppose <m>\Delta = (V,E,c,s,t)</m> is a capacitated network with source <m>s</m> and target <m>t</m>. An <m>s-t cut</m> is a partition <m>C=(S,T)</m> such that <m>s\in S</m> and <m>t\in T</m>. The <term>cut-set</term> of <m>C</m> is the set of edges <m>\set{uv\in E:u\in S, v\in T}</m>. We notice that if a flow of <m>0</m> is put on all edges in the cur-set of <m>C</m>, then <m>\abs{f}=0</m>. The <term>capacity</term> of the cut <m>C=(S,T)</m> is
<me>
  c(S,T) = \sum_{\set{uv\in E: u\in S, v\in T}}c(u,v).
</me>
</p>

<p>
Just as it is interesting to determine a maximum flow over a network, there are applications when finding a minimum-capacity cut-set is desirable.

<theorem>
<title>Max-flow Min-cut Theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
The maximum value of an <m>s</m>-<m>t</m> flow is equal to the minimum capacity of an <m>s</m>-<m>t</m> cut.
